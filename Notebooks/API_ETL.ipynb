I discovered my car a 0% battery range with a dead 12 volt as well just as it had depleted and discovered the burnt up wires.  I charged the 12 volt and got the car to take a charge.  The 20 amp charge setting upon starting the car had changed itself to 50 amps.  I lowered the setting and began charging the car.    I was then able to move my car to a faster 50 amp circuit because the 120 v 10 amp circuit was going to take 3-4 days to charge the car or longer.  I plugged the car into the 50 amp circuit set at 40 amps and let the car charge.  An update was then pushed to the car.  After the update completed.  I got a charging error message via the app.  I went to the screen and checked my charger.  My Gen 2 wall charger indicated an overvoltage error and my car screen showed it tried to pull 80 amps off my 50 amp circuit.  I lowered the amps back down and reset my wall charger.    It appears after updates or at random, the car is changing the charge amps and sometimes exceeding the amperage the outlets and wires can provide.  If the in house breaker or circuit in the wall charger doesn't trip, the car will pull in more amps than the circuit can handle and may cause a fire.  This is a dangerous potential problem that I luckily narrowly avoided.  I contacted Tesla about this issue.  The car is set for evaluation at my expense since it is out of warranty.  I have burnt wires, almost lost my high voltage battery to zero'ing its charge, and could have lost my shop or life.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2012', 'productMake': 'TESLA', 'productModel': 'MODEL S', 'manufacturer': 'Tesla, Inc.'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11468855, 'manufacturer': 'Tesla, Inc.', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '03/08/2022', 'dateComplaintFiled': '06/12/2022', 'vin': '5YJSA1CP0CF', 'components': 'ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,FUEL/PROPULSION SYSTEM', 'summary': 'Both the 12 volt system and High voltage battery system or a component communicating between the two failed.

As an owner of a 2020 Tesla Model Y (VIN: [XXX] ), I have experienced numerous problems related to the vehicle's suspension system, steering, and safety restraints, which I believe pose serious safety risks.  My vehicle has undergone multiple repairs at Tesla service centers for issues such as squeaking noises when turning, vehicle shutdowns while driving, steering difficulties, and excessive tire wear.  Many of these problems are related to the vehicle's suspension system, which has been the subject of several recalls by Tesla in recent years, including recalls [XXX],[XXX], [XXX], and [XXX].  Despite these recalls supposedly addressing the suspension issues, my vehicle continues to experience problems. Most recently, on [XXX], I brought my vehicle to a Tesla service center for a loud and distinct sound coming from the steering system.  The service center diagnosed the issue and recommended repairs to the front half shaft assembly, front damper assembly, and front lower lateral links, with a total estimated cost of $3,670. These issues should be covered under warranty and are directly related to the previous suspension recalls. However, Tesla has refused to cover the repairs under warranty.  Furthermore, I have experienced recurring issues with the front passenger safety restraint system, which required a retrofit of the Occupant Classification System (OCS) on two separate occasions. This suggests that the initial repair was ineffective and that the system may have an underlying design flaw.  I request that the NHTSA investigate these issues and take appropriate action to ensure Tesla addresses these safety concerns and honors its warranty obligations. I have attached documentation detailing the repair history, invoices, recall notices, and correspondence with Tesla.

I am a Tesla Model Y owner, and following this update, I have experienced complete failure of critical vehicle systems including cameras, navigation, lane departure warnings, auto braking, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, windshield wipers, self-driving features, and car location data.  The malfunction of these essential features not only compromises the safety and functionality of the vehicle but also indicates a severe underlying problem with the vehicle's computer system. The cost to replace the affected computer in my vehicle amounted to $2,400. However, upon reviewing discussions on Tesla forums, I have discovered that this is not an isolated incident; numerous other owners are facing similar failures, with some repair bills exceeding $3,000.  Given the widespread nature of these issues and their chronological association with the December software update, there appears to be a high correlation between the update and the catastrophic failure of the vehicle computers. The financial burden of these repairs has unjustly fallen on consumers, although it is my belief that Tesla should be held accountable for these failures, given the direct link to their software update.  I urge the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to investigate this matter thoroughly. It is critical to ascertain whether the December software update directly caused the failures of the vehicle's computer systems and to ensure that Tesla takes appropriate responsibility for the safety and reliability of their vehicles. This includes compensating owners for the costs incurred due to these failures and implementing measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

Last 2 years were spent in New England during which freeway range started to drop precipitously, reaching a low of 166 miles (100% to 1% state of charge; about 420 Wh/mi) at freezing temperatures; verified across two identical road trips. Cold weather range was expected, but in retrospect, this was far too much of a drop.   Now back in California, range has dropped even further and settled at about ~150 miles -- or an abysmal 450 Wh/mi -- i.e., a 40% drop from the OEM tires, and a 34% drop from the new tires.  All charging stats (and Tesla's remote tests) show the battery is at full capacity (69 kWh is a 1% to 100% recharge and the battery is rated at 70 kWh).   Tesla claims no faults, and assign blame to driver (high freeway speeds; Sentry Mode; climate control; etc).   Tesla now threatening -- as indicated in recent class action lawsuit -- to charge $275/hr if I continue to press the issue, even though I have explained rental Model Y vehicles have vastly better range.  I have insisted on several options:   (A) Pay for a loaner to test. - NO (B) I will rent another Model Y from Hertz and report back with data. - NO (C) Acknowledge the problem, I want to pay to fix it. - NO (D) Acknowledge the problem, but you don't know how to fix it. - NO  It is clear I am now being strong-armed by their Diversion Team.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2020', 'productMake': 'TESLA', 'productModel': 'MODEL Y', 'manufacturer': 'Tesla, Inc.'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11543764, 'manufacturer': 'Tesla, Inc.', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '09/10/2023', 'dateComplaintFiled': '09/11/2023', 'vin': '5YJYGDEEXLF', 'components': 'SEAT BELTS', 'summary': 'Passenger rear seat seatbelt stopped working abruptly.

Tesla subsequently fixed this problem, first by applying a sticker over the holes in the circuit board, and later by redesigning the part entirely.  But this “light leak” problem exists on hundreds of thousands of cars.  There are two problems with this: 1) Tesla has now changed their “Autopilot” and “Full Self Driving” software to a Tesla Vision system that ONLY uses cameras for the autopilot features, including lane keeping and lane changes.  They no longer use ultrasonic sensors or forward looking radar, even though it is still installed on these cars.  This reliance on vision makes it impossible for the Tesla side facing cameras to see when the blinker is turned on.  This can result in unpredictable behavior when changing lanes or turning at night with autopilot engaged, including unpredictable or erratic driving where the car abandons a lane change mid course and swerves back into the lane. 2) Even when autopilot is not engaged, the blind spot monitoring in this car consists of a pop up window on the center screen showing the side view camera when the turn signal is engaged.  At night, with the blinker on, the driver sees a bright light flashing intermittently in the side view camera.  This is very distracting and potentially hazardous to the driver.

In the Chevy Bolt owners manual, under winter driving, the first bullet point they make is to put the car in D--which turns off regenerative braking.  You can reduce the amount of regenerative braking on a Tesla, but you can not turn it off.  Under driving in winter on the Tesla on the website, there is no mention of reducing the regenerative braking in snow or ice.

On Monday, [XXX] I was driving home on the Highway when a warning light came on telling me to check EV Connection, it was an orange message. Then the light and message switched to red and displayed a battery symbol. The message said to stop vehicle and check power supply. My acceleration slowed down and I couldn't go above 25 mph despite attempts to speed up. There were many cars on the road when this happened, and I automatically turned on my emergency blinkers. There was a large 16-wheeler behind me that noted something was wrong and slowed down with his emergency lights blinking as well to support me. I panicked and found the nearest exit to come off the highway and before I could make it to the traffic light, the car shut off unexpectedly and completely stopped with no warning. Attempts to restart the vehicle did not yield positive results. After 2 hours of waiting for a tow truck in the middle of the road blocking traffic and waving people around my car, I was able to tow my vehicle to a dealership in NJ close by my house. As it was evening time, I left it at the dealership service center and dropped keys in drop box. I spent several days on the phone with Hyundai Service Center arguing to get my car checked as they told me that appointments were all booked, despite this being an emergency. I had no idea what was happening, but it was clearly inoperable, and I made that very clear. Finally, today, Thursday, [XXX] they confirmed that diagnostic testing showed ICCU failure. They advised that the part is on back-order, and they issued me a loaner for the time being. I have no idea how long this will take to fix.

I have a 40 amp Level 2 charger I frequently use to charge my car. I first noticed it a few weeks ago, where my car seemingly stopped charging for no reason. I brushed it off, then unplugged it + plugged it back in and the rest of the session went fine. Lately, as temps have been rising I noticed the car failing charging sessions one, or two times per day. After doing some research, it turns out i’m far from the only one having this issue. Many other others have been experiencing the same issue as I, and the same degradation. Some people who were initially able to charge their car at 11kw, are now only to charge around 5kw, otherwise the cars onboard AC charger gets too hot and ends the charging session. I have started to see my car degrade as well, as I have had to lower my charge rate to 32a. I have tested out Level 2 AC charging on other chargers as well to rule out my charger being the problem, and it happens on them too unfortunately.  To combat this AC charger overheating issue, Hyundai has released a TSB number 23-EV-003H. Unfortunately, the only thing this TSB does is kneecap the cars ability to level 2 charge at a decent rate. After the TSB is applied, once the car detects an overheating onboard AC charger, it will throttle the AC charge rate all the way down to around 5kw. This is unacceptable, when owners of the Ioniq 5 and 6 were promised a vehicle that is able to do 11kw AC charging, or as claimed on Hyundais website, a Level 2 charge from 10-100 in 6 hours and 43 minutes. With my car throttled to 32 amps, it doesn’t charge nearly as fast adding hours onto the total time required to charge. This is an issue for me because I do not have a place to come home to every single night to charge my car, i’m only able to stop by the charger momentarily which means securing as much energy as fast as possible through Level 2 charging is very important to me.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11533955, 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '03/01/2023', 'dateComplaintFiled': '07/23/2023', 'vin': 'KM8KRDAF0NU', 'components': 'ELECTRICAL SYSTEM', 'summary': 'Car intermittently stops charging using a level two charger.

This is an extremely convenient mode of driving in normal operation, yielding very smooth, passenger-friendly (acceleration and) deceleration by avoiding use of the brake pedals altogether.  The problem is that the 2022 Ioniq 5 will *never* activate the brake lights (\"stop lamps\") when decelerating in i-pedal mode, as long as I apply any pressure at all on the accelerator pedal.  This gives drivers behind me no notice that I am slowing down until I\\'m almost completely stopped.  This seems to meet current DOT standards, but ONLY because I\\'m not using the brakes to decelerate. If I slow down at a similar rate using brakes, the brakes lights do turn on.  I recently submitted a similar complaint to Hyundai: Consumer Affairs Case#: 21492175.  For a more thorough explanation & demonstration, see this video from the Technology Connections channel on YouTube — he has exactly the same model as me (and I independently verified the behavior on my car with a driver following me): https://youtu.be/U0YW7x9U5TQ   My complaint is to the DOT as much as to Hyundai: safety will be improved if the illumination of brake lights (\"stop lamps\") is required no matter what mechanism the driver is using to slow down, for all manufacturers and models (though this will likely only apply to Electric Vehicles or hybrids).

Regenerative breaking can be set at level 1, 2, 3, or i-pedal mode. This determines the strength in which the car will engage regenerative breaking automatically when the position of the accelerator petal is raised above the current speed. i-pedal mode is full one-pedal driving, allowing the driver to slow to a stop without use of the break pedal at all. At level 2, 3, or i-pedal, the car is capable of decelerating at a significant rate even when the driver is still pressing down on the pedal. For example, if you consider it as a percentage and take \"foot off the pedal\" as 0%, and \"pedal pressed as far as it can go\" as 100%, a driver could be traveling at 70 mph on the highway, with the pedal pressed at around 60%. The driver could then lift the pedal to only 30%, and the regenerative breaking would then slow the car to, say, 30 mph. This deceleration can be very strong when set to a high regen level. However, the break lights do not illuminate unless the driver takes their foot completely off of the accelerator. In i-pedal mode especially, it is possible to decelerate from highway speed to a near stop in only a matter of seconds, without the break lights ever activating. Other EV manufacturers illuminate the break lights based on the cars measured deceleration when using regenerative breaking, and do not have this issue. If the driver has driven other EVs in the past and prefers the one pedal driving mode, it is likely they will not even know that their break lights are not illuminating during heavy deceleration, creating a significant danger of being rear ended when driving in heavy traffic.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11523974, 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '05/25/2023', 'dateComplaintFiled': '05/26/2023', 'vin': 'KM8KRDAF6NU', 'components': 'EXTERIOR LIGHTING', 'summary': 'This vehicle can use regenerative braking to slow fully to a stop.

While in this mode, when I fully lift my foot off the accelerator, the rear brake lights illuminate as expected, however, I often slowly reduce pressure on the accelerator pedal to come gently to a stop. I\\'ve noticed that it\\'s possible (and often the case) that I can decelerate to a full stop without the brake lights illuminating until I fully release the brake pedal (at the very last moment before I stop). This means that I can be slowing down at a pretty significant rate without any indication to the drivers behind.   Conversely, when using the automatic cruise control (that keeps the car a set distance from car ahead), the brake lights seem overly active and flash on and off quite frequently, especially when going down hills (even if there is no deceleration and the car seems to be coasting).  Both of these anomalies seem to aggravate other drivers following the car for different reasons, since the vehicle\\'s intent isn\\'t being properly communicated. The lack of expected brake lights when decelerating gently via i-Pedal mode seems potentially dangerous.  I would recommend that Hyundai tune their software so that the brake lights illuminate automatically past a set threshold of deceleration/regen braking (above what would be expected if the car were simply coasting), but not requiring the driver to fully lift off the pedal, since at that point, the rate of deceleration is already uncomfortably high for typical driving.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11520815, 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '05/07/2023', 'dateComplaintFiled': '05/07/2023', 'vin': 'KM8KMDAF6NU', 'components': 'ELECTRICAL SYSTEM', 'summary': 'Last night I had an update pushed to my car.

This can happen after 1 hour or after many hours of charging. If using specific chargers, the charging will restart after a 10 second delay and oftentimes the car will continue to trip and start recharging multiple times. This can lead to heating up of the charging cord and potentially tripping the main breaker feeding the charger. In the car you can change the charging current from maximum to reduced to minimum. The issue appears to happen mostly on maximum and reduced charge, but has not happened on minimum yet. The issue is reproducible on multiple level 2 chargers and appears to be a common issue across numerous other owners. I have attempted to have the dealership investigate, but they are too new and or ignorant to electric vehicles that they won't take my advice on how to reproduce the issue and thus have not been any help. This issue is not related to DC charging which leads me to believe it's either electrical pin related or an issue with the AC to DC converter on the car. Besides, not getting the full use of the car I paid for, this issue can leave a user stranded if the charger fails to charge the car when expected, but also could be a potential fire hazard with the excessive heating of the charging module and associated charging cords.

Called Mullinax Ford in Apopka Florida second week in January and clearly stated I was calling to schedule an appointment for HVBJB recall, noted above. Appointment was made for next available which was February 12, 2024.  4. February 12, 2012 I take vehicle to Mullinax Ford for 7:30am appointment. Advisor writes up HVBJB issues along with tire rotation and another software update for stuck charging plug.  5. Throughout the 6 hours of waiting at the dealer the service advisor neither updates me or informs me that the HVBJB recall is not taking place. They apparently performed another recall for a parking break release cable that was neither listed on the ford site or NHTSA as a recall applicable to my vehicle.  6. At the end of the 6hours they hand back my vehicle without the HVBJB recall performed and could not tell me when it could be performed or if parts were available or if they had even checked for the parts. They simply said they would get back in touch. I left to mull things over and clear my head.  7. Called back Mullinax Ford from the car and talked to someone named Michael after asking for the service manager. Explained I specially made the appointment a month ago for the HVBJB recall and that didn't happen and I wanted to know when they could have the part on hand and when I could schedule the recall. He said he would research it and call me back. 8. As of [XXX], three days later, I have not received an update.  9. The recall status now shows remedy unavailable again which means the part is obviously on back order. 10. This HVBJB problem surfaced in early 2022. The first recall which consisted of a software update in was issued in June 2022. There is no excuse for not having ample parts to remedy this in 2024. No long distance/fast charge driving.

I have received this letter on my 2022 mach e and 2023 one and I will make a complaint for both. There should not only be a recall opened up on this to properly inspect every single charging port for any kind of arching as any kind of arching may have caused damage not only to the pins but the entire electrical system or any one of the components that go from the pins to the batteries. Furthermore of a recall I also ask that an investigation be opened to Ford itself since they cannot tell customers who pay a ton of money for there vehicles why they did not open a recall or notify Nhsta in the first place.

Ford has faulty charging cables that they know about and have not recalled voluntarily. This I have an issue with because it is causing the battery on my car to overheat and put it at a potential risk of catastrophic thermal runaway incident. I have had two charging cables go bad on my car. I just got my car back today and I noticed the new cable has a new part number on it as well as different types of wiring marked on the outer portion of the top cable. This is the gauge of wiring that is being used to plug into the outlet of my home to the actual charging conversion. Look at the old and new cable pictures and notice the white markings on these cables the gauge or wiring is different. Now the part number of the one on the white car I am not sure at all which one was turned in as I no longer have it anymore but what I can tell you is on the white converter itself with part number LJ98-10f868-AL is the new part number cable which I just got and have no issues with. The other one part number LJ98-10f868-AK is the older part number cable that I have seen the amber light staying on that says that it's in an undercharging condition due to overheating. So with this said Ford is aware there is a defect in the charging cables of previous models prior to AL. I have had two other charging cables go bad before I just got this AL one how is this possible with no recall?  These prior model charging cables are putting stress on the electrical system of the car. I can tell because with these old cables I hear the cooling fans coming on super loud which yeah the cooling fan is supposed to come on but im pretty sure the undercharging should not happen on the cable unless the battery is overheating. With this said you must open an investigation to look into these charging cables and what is changing the part numbers. It seems to me they are using different gauge wiring and type of wiring for the part that plugs into the wall.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'FORD', 'productModel': 'MUSTANG MACH E', 'manufacturer': 'Ford Motor Company'}]}, {'odiNumber': 11545115, 'manufacturer': 'Ford Motor Company', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '09/17/2023', 'dateComplaintFiled': '09/18/2023', 'vin': '3FMTK3R71NM', 'components': 'VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL,FORWARD COLLISION AVOIDANCE,LANE DEPARTURE', 'summary': \"While driving on I-40 East between Raleigh, NC and Benson, NC I was trying to use the Blue Cruise self driving feature on my Mache.

The message in the app also indicated to contact the dealer immediately. I would estimate that max acceleration was instantly reduced over 30%, causing a great concern while cruising at highway speeds. Previous to the date of this incident, the warning/check engine light never turned on. I made the next exit to use secondary roads as a precautionary measure since the max acceleration was limited. I am very active in various Mach-E forums, and this is a well-known issue for Ford. These messages are the ones related to a potential design problem with the High Voltage Battery Junction Box (HVBJB) included in my vehicle (Mach-Es built on or before May 28, 2023). My production date was January 2022. This vehicle got the safety recall #22S41 (software update) at the dealer last year. The software basically allowed the driver to get these warning messages if issues with the HVBJB contactors were detected. It is noteworthy to mention that I did not get the “Stop Safely Now” message, which would have made the vehicle undrivable. Next morning the wrench symbol disappeared from my instrument cluster.   Ford issued a technical service bulletin #23-2257 to address a fix, which will involve the replacement of the potentially defective HVBJB for a redesigned one. The dealer indicated the remedy Ford provided was the software update, however multiple owners have reported the replacement of the potential defective part by Ford can only be done if the vehicle is totally inoperable showing the \"Stop Safely Now\" message.

This means according to the chart I saw online that the charging is reduced because it's overheating. So I drove it around on August 29th,2023 with a high temperature outside of 105 degrees F that day. The low I believe in Murrieta, CA that night was 70 degrees F. Since it's charging in the garage, you have to account for an extra 10-18 degrees F of heat since most garages are not air-conditioned. This coupled with the high voltage battery connector failure recall that is also currently being investigated leaves me to believe the battery itself may be overheating causing the high voltage battery connector to weld itself shut and 240v Ford charging cables to fry. With both of these issues currently happening I believe it puts us at a higher risk for a catastrophic thermal runaway event. My recommendation would be to check Ford's testing of the electrical battery system. Was it tested driven during 105 F weather then charged overnight multiple times on a 240V Ford charging cable that comes with the car? Was the fact that 10-18 Degrees F that a garage is much hotter then it is outside? I have had two charging cables fail with under 25k miles. This leads me to believe the battery is overheating and catastrophic thermal runaway is at a greater risk with all these issues.

I asked them does this mean the airbag system will not work in an accident? They said yes. I suggested pulling an airbag module from one of the cars in their inventory and using it to repair the car. They said no. They left us drive the car away with the airbag light still on. I researched on the internet finding a airbag module for the car. I informed them of the research and website. They said they called the other VW dealer but the part was not available even though the part was showing as available on the website.

Around Sept 12 while plugged in to the 30 amp, the car pulled in 50 amps off the line causing a melting of the wires and a near fire based on the damages later found.  The car is supposed to send charging error alerts or problems via the Tesla app.  Instead it continued to try to pull power out of the burnt line for 11 days all the while further depleting the battery.  I discovered my car a 0% battery range with a dead 12 volt as well just as it had depleted and discovered the burnt up wires.  I charged the 12 volt and got the car to take a charge.  The 20 amp charge setting upon starting the car had changed itself to 50 amps.  I lowered the setting and began charging the car.    I was then able to move my car to a faster 50 amp circuit because the 120 v 10 amp circuit was going to take 3-4 days to charge the car or longer.  I plugged the car into the 50 amp circuit set at 40 amps and let the car charge.  An update was then pushed to the car.  After the update completed.  I got a charging error message via the app.  I went to the screen and checked my charger.  My Gen 2 wall charger indicated an overvoltage error and my car screen showed it tried to pull 80 amps off my 50 amp circuit.  I lowered the amps back down and reset my wall charger.    It appears after updates or at random, the car is changing the charge amps and sometimes exceeding the amperage the outlets and wires can provide.  If the in house breaker or circuit in the wall charger doesn't trip, the car will pull in more amps than the circuit can handle and may cause a fire.  This is a dangerous potential problem that I luckily narrowly avoided.  I contacted Tesla about this issue.  The car is set for evaluation at my expense since it is out of warranty.

As an owner of a 2020 Tesla Model Y (VIN: [XXX] ), I have experienced numerous problems related to the vehicle's suspension system, steering, and safety restraints, which I believe pose serious safety risks.  My vehicle has undergone multiple repairs at Tesla service centers for issues such as squeaking noises when turning, vehicle shutdowns while driving, steering difficulties, and excessive tire wear.  Many of these problems are related to the vehicle's suspension system, which has been the subject of several recalls by Tesla in recent years, including recalls [XXX],[XXX], [XXX], and [XXX].  Despite these recalls supposedly addressing the suspension issues, my vehicle continues to experience problems. Most recently, on [XXX], I brought my vehicle to a Tesla service center for a loud and distinct sound coming from the steering system.  The service center diagnosed the issue and recommended repairs to the front half shaft assembly, front damper assembly, and front lower lateral links, with a total estimated cost of $3,670. These issues should be covered under warranty and are directly related to the previous suspension recalls. However, Tesla has refused to cover the repairs under warranty.  Furthermore, I have experienced recurring issues with the front passenger safety restraint system, which required a retrofit of the Occupant Classification System (OCS) on two separate occasions. This suggests that the initial repair was ineffective and that the system may have an underlying design flaw.  I request that the NHTSA investigate these issues and take appropriate action to ensure Tesla addresses these safety concerns and honors its warranty obligations.

The malfunction of these essential features not only compromises the safety and functionality of the vehicle but also indicates a severe underlying problem with the vehicle's computer system. The cost to replace the affected computer in my vehicle amounted to $2,400. However, upon reviewing discussions on Tesla forums, I have discovered that this is not an isolated incident; numerous other owners are facing similar failures, with some repair bills exceeding $3,000.  Given the widespread nature of these issues and their chronological association with the December software update, there appears to be a high correlation between the update and the catastrophic failure of the vehicle computers. The financial burden of these repairs has unjustly fallen on consumers, although it is my belief that Tesla should be held accountable for these failures, given the direct link to their software update.  I urge the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to investigate this matter thoroughly. It is critical to ascertain whether the December software update directly caused the failures of the vehicle's computer systems and to ensure that Tesla takes appropriate responsibility for the safety and reliability of their vehicles.

This was tested repeatedly, numerous times, on multiple road trips.   At ~12K miles into ownership, OEM tires were swapped as they were dangerously useless in rain and snow. Repeated calculations confirmed ~10% range loss. This meant that average Wh/mi consumption went from about ~280 Wh/mi to about ~308 Wh/mi, for a real world freeway range reduction to about 227 from say 250 (again 100% to 1% SoC). This was expected and accepted.

Cold weather range was expected, but in retrospect, this was far too much of a drop.   Now back in California, range has dropped even further and settled at about ~150 miles -- or an abysmal 450 Wh/mi -- i.e., a 40% drop from the OEM tires, and a 34% drop from the new tires.

Got the car back home (we were only a few miles away) but it is sitting slightly lower on right side in front and from what I can see it looks like there is a holder for a bolt that is “empty” (i.e. I think a bolt fell off and cause the car to go lower to friend and turning the car toward that side is now noisy and impossible to turn —there is resistance).  I see some 2020 Model Y’s had a recall for a suspension issue but when I plug in my VIN it appears it doesn’t apply to my VIN.

You can even watch youtube videos of other Tesla drivers experiencing the exact same scenario as my family currently has.   The day it happened I drove straight to a Tesla service center to get it taken care of.  They told me they were too busy to take my car and that I needed to make an appointment.  Their first appointment date at the local center was over 2 weeks out, which is also unacceptable for an issue involving passenger safety.   So I set up a mobile service appointment for the following day which the following day Tesla changed to a service center appointment a week and a half out, citing they needed to order parts to fix this, granted no one has seen this door to diagnose what is happening but they already know enough to order parts to fix it, which means that indeed they have a manufacturing flaw that needs to be adressed.

Tesla subsequently fixed this problem, first by applying a sticker over the holes in the circuit board, and later by redesigning the part entirely.  But this “light leak” problem exists on hundreds of thousands of cars.  There are two problems with this: 1) Tesla has now changed their “Autopilot” and “Full Self Driving” software to a Tesla Vision system that ONLY uses cameras for the autopilot features, including lane keeping and lane changes.  They no longer use ultrasonic sensors or forward looking radar, even though it is still installed on these cars.  This reliance on vision makes it impossible for the Tesla side facing cameras to see when the blinker is turned on.  This can result in unpredictable behavior when changing lanes or turning at night with autopilot engaged, including unpredictable or erratic driving where the car abandons a lane change mid course and swerves back into the lane. 2) Even when autopilot is not engaged, the blind spot monitoring in this car consists of a pop up window on the center screen showing the side view camera when the turn signal is engaged.  At night, with the blinker on, the driver sees a bright light flashing intermittently in the side view camera.  This is very distracting and potentially hazardous to the driver.

After coming to a complete stop before making the turn, she drove about 150 feet when the car swerved to the right and the right rear passenger side of our Tesla Model Y hit left rear driver’s side of another car (BMW).  I drove over to assist her and it appears from the AAA tow truck driver that a part of the axle on the right passenger side rear wheel broke later confirmed by my insurance agent and my auto mechanic. It was surprising since she was had completed the turn, was driving slowly straight on Agana Drive at approximately 25mph when this part broke. Apparently, nobody was seriously injured, the parked car had nobody in it and no real estate property damage appears to have occurred. was knocked up and over the curb due to the force of the impact braking the other car's rear axle and bending the frame. Our car is still being repaired a month later.  Tesla appears to know about the problem since, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there is a recall scheduled for 2020-2021 Tesla Model Y cars with a recall date of 2021-11-20, recall no. 21V912000, recall notification stating Tesla, Inc (Tesla) is recalling certain 2020-2022 Model Y vehicles. The front and rear suspension knuckles may fracture, causing the suspension links to separate, recall consequence stating Suspension links that separate can reduce vehicle stability and control, increasing the risk of a crash and a recall action stating Tesla Service will inspect and replace the knuckles as necessary, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed 18 January 2022. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla’s number for this recall is SB-21-31-004.

Then the light and message switched to red and displayed a battery symbol. The message said to stop vehicle and check power supply. My acceleration slowed down and I couldn't go above 25 mph despite attempts to speed up. There were many cars on the road when this happened, and I automatically turned on my emergency blinkers. There was a large 16-wheeler behind me that noted something was wrong and slowed down with his emergency lights blinking as well to support me.

Attempts to restart the vehicle did not yield positive results. After 2 hours of waiting for a tow truck in the middle of the road blocking traffic and waving people around my car, I was able to tow my vehicle to a dealership in NJ close by my house.

Similar to others who have reported ICCU failures, I suffered a rapid loss of power on the road, and within minutes, a complete loss of motive power. I received a “check EV system” and “reduced power” warning, followed very quickly by “check power supply, pull over immediately.” While I was able to pull to the roadside, this easily may not have been the case, causing significant danger. The dealer confirmed the issue and eventually replaced the parts. A loss of motive power within minutes or seconds is potentially life-threatening. Hyundai’s proposed fix for the issue — inspection and perhaps software update — is clearly inadequate to address the problem, since my vehicle failed after the service campaign had already been performed.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}\n",

There is a TSB they are installing but it just makes it automatically derate to ~24 amps which other than providing 15 minutes of higher power it doesn't at all solve the situation.  Hyundai has recently stated that they are aware of the issue and they expect people to live with it and re-adjust their expectations; but it is fair to expect the car to perform as advertised.  I also don't think any caveats about charging speed for weather or state of charge would be specific to level 3 charging; I am not aware of another EV in existence that doesn't provide its advertised AC charging level.  It pretty clearly appears to be defective hardware.  We also have friends who bought their car a month later (July 2023) and they are having the same issue; albeit they can still charge at 32amps.  To answer the questions directly. - Charge Port - The cars cannot charge in time advertised making people drive without buffers and could run out of power on trips because they can only charge at half the rate advertised and couldn't charge overnight. - We are getting the TSB that will automatically reduce the charging rate this week.  we had to wait over a month for an appointment. - It has not been inspected yet but all they are going to do per the TSB is if we say we have the problem they do the software update. - There are no customer facing error codes.  The issue first started in March the first day it was over 70 degrees.  We did not have an issue last summer or over the winter.  The longest we can charge since then at 40 amps is about 15 minutes.

I have a 40 amp Level 2 charger I frequently use to charge my car. I first noticed it a few weeks ago, where my car seemingly stopped charging for no reason. I brushed it off, then unplugged it + plugged it back in and the rest of the session went fine. Lately, as temps have been rising I noticed the car failing charging sessions one, or two times per day. After doing some research, it turns out i’m far from the only one having this issue. Many other others have been experiencing the same issue as I, and the same degradation. Some people who were initially able to charge their car at 11kw, are now only to charge around 5kw, otherwise the cars onboard AC charger gets too hot and ends the charging session. I have started to see my car degrade as well, as I have had to lower my charge rate to 32a. I have tested out Level 2 AC charging on other chargers as well to rule out my charger being the problem, and it happens on them too unfortunately.  To combat this AC charger overheating issue, Hyundai has released a TSB number 23-EV-003H. Unfortunately, the only thing this TSB does is kneecap the cars ability to level 2 charge at a decent rate. After the TSB is applied, once the car detects an overheating onboard AC charger, it will throttle the AC charge rate all the way down to around 5kw. This is unacceptable, when owners of the Ioniq 5 and 6 were promised a vehicle that is able to do 11kw AC charging, or as claimed on Hyundais website, a Level 2 charge from 10-100 in 6 hours and 43 minutes. With my car throttled to 32 amps, it doesn’t charge nearly as fast adding hours onto the total time required to charge. This is an issue for me because I do not have a place to come home to every single night to charge my car, i’m only able to stop by the charger momentarily which means securing as much energy as fast as possible through Level 2 charging is very important to me.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}\n",

Regenerative breaking can be set at level 1, 2, 3, or i-pedal mode. This determines the strength in which the car will engage regenerative breaking automatically when the position of the accelerator petal is raised above the current speed. i-pedal mode is full one-pedal driving, allowing the driver to slow to a stop without use of the break pedal at all. At level 2, 3, or i-pedal, the car is capable of decelerating at a significant rate even when the driver is still pressing down on the pedal. For example, if you consider it as a percentage and take \"foot off the pedal\" as 0%, and \"pedal pressed as far as it can go\" as 100%, a driver could be traveling at 70 mph on the highway, with the pedal pressed at around 60%. The driver could then lift the pedal to only 30%, and the regenerative breaking would then slow the car to, say, 30 mph. This deceleration can be very strong when set to a high regen level. However, the break lights do not illuminate unless the driver takes their foot completely off of the accelerator. In i-pedal mode especially, it is possible to decelerate from highway speed to a near stop in only a matter of seconds, without the break lights ever activating. Other EV manufacturers illuminate the break lights based on the cars measured deceleration when using regenerative breaking, and do not have this issue. If the driver has driven other EVs in the past and prefers the one pedal driving mode, it is likely they will not even know that their break lights are not illuminating during heavy deceleration, creating a significant danger of being rear ended when driving in heavy traffic.', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'HYUNDAI', 'productModel': 'IONIQ 5', 'manufacturer': 'Hyundai Motor America'}]}\n",

They determined that \"nothing was wrong\" which made no sense to me. My wife picked up the car and approximately one week later, the exact same thing happened again. This time we dropped the car off at the dealer where it\\'s been for nearly one month. With their customer service lacking and information not forthcoming, I had to go to the dealer myself to get some answers.

Our dealer has several Ioniq5s awaiting ICCU replacement for the same problem as my car, but they \"can\\'t get the part from Hyundai\".

This issue is not related to DC charging which leads me to believe it's either electrical pin related or an issue with the AC to DC converter on the car. Besides, not getting the full use of the car I paid for, this issue can leave a user stranded if the charger fails to charge the car when expected, but also could be a potential fire hazard with the excessive heating of the charging module and associated charging cords. In the attached photos you can see how often the car charging will trip as I get a notification in my phone app each time it stops charging. If you're inside the car watching the dashboard when this happens, it will flash check EV system very briefly while it trips and restarts.

If you have to apply the brakes quickly or get into a accident, the article will be shooting forward on the liner very quickly and possibly striking the driver or passenger seat back or possibly in the back of their heads. The object could also move into the front seat area. Hitting the seat back or driver with this added force and or weight will be just more dangerous added that the air bags could possibly be going off.

The contact stated that the doors locked with her son and two dogs inside the vehicle. The window was down approximately three inches. The contact's child was inside the vehicle but was unable to unlock the doors from inside the vehicle due to the 12-volt battery being drained. The contact stated that the hood failed to open. The manufacturer was contacted, and referred the contact of Ford SYNC and informed the contact that the vehicle was flagged, and the 12-volt battery was low, and an update was needed, and directed her to Roadside Assistance. The contact called Roadside Assistance, who was unable to jump the vehicle with several jumping devices. The contact used a portable battery to access the vehicle. The vehicle began making an abnormal knocking noise and jerking. The Fire Department was on the scene and was able to assist. The contact pulled down the rear window, knocked the window off track, and was able to get into the vehicle. The contact was able to climb through the window, pump the brake pedal, open the door, open the hood, jumpstart, and charge the vehicle. The contact was able to drive the vehicle. The manufacturer was contacted again and opened a case. The contact provided feedback and was referred to the local dealer and to the NHTSA Hotline. The failure mileage was approximately 19,995.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'FORD', 'productModel': 'MUSTANG MACH E', 'manufacturer': 'Ford Motor Company'}]}\n",

Called Mullinax Ford in Apopka Florida second week in January and clearly stated I was calling to schedule an appointment for HVBJB recall, noted above. Appointment was made for next available which was February 12, 2024.  4. February 12, 2012 I take vehicle to Mullinax Ford for 7:30am appointment. Advisor writes up HVBJB issues along with tire rotation and another software update for stuck charging plug.  5. Throughout the 6 hours of waiting at the dealer the service advisor neither updates me or informs me that the HVBJB recall is not taking place. They apparently performed another recall for a parking break release cable that was neither listed on the ford site or NHTSA as a recall applicable to my vehicle.  6. At the end of the 6hours they hand back my vehicle without the HVBJB recall performed and could not tell me when it could be performed or if parts were available or if they had even checked for the parts. They simply said they would get back in touch. I left to mull things over and clear my head.  7. Called back Mullinax Ford from the car and talked to someone named Michael after asking for the service manager. Explained I specially made the appointment a month ago for the HVBJB recall and that didn't happen and I wanted to know when they could have the part on hand and when I could schedule the recall. He said he would research it and call me back. 8. As of [XXX], three days later, I have not received an update.  9. The recall status now shows remedy unavailable again which means the part is obviously on back order. 10. This HVBJB problem surfaced in early 2022. The first recall which consisted of a software update in was issued in June 2022. There is no excuse for not having ample parts to remedy this in 2024. No long distance/fast charge driving.

I have received this letter on my 2022 mach e and 2023 one and I will make a complaint for both. There should not only be a recall opened up on this to properly inspect every single charging port for any kind of arching as any kind of arching may have caused damage not only to the pins but the entire electrical system or any one of the components that go from the pins to the batteries. Furthermore of a recall I also ask that an investigation be opened to Ford itself since they cannot tell customers who pay a ton of money for there vehicles why they did not open a recall or notify Nhsta in the first place.

Ford has faulty charging cables that they know about and have not recalled voluntarily. This I have an issue with because it is causing the battery on my car to overheat and put it at a potential risk of catastrophic thermal runaway incident. I have had two charging cables go bad on my car. I just got my car back today and I noticed the new cable has a new part number on it as well as different types of wiring marked on the outer portion of the top cable. This is the gauge of wiring that is being used to plug into the outlet of my home to the actual charging conversion. Look at the old and new cable pictures and notice the white markings on these cables the gauge or wiring is different. Now the part number of the one on the white car I am not sure at all which one was turned in as I no longer have it anymore but what I can tell you is on the white converter itself with part number LJ98-10f868-AL is the new part number cable which I just got and have no issues with. The other one part number LJ98-10f868-AK is the older part number cable that I have seen the amber light staying on that says that it's in an undercharging condition due to overheating. So with this said Ford is aware there is a defect in the charging cables of previous models prior to AL. I have had two other charging cables go bad before I just got this AL one how is this possible with no recall?  These prior model charging cables are putting stress on the electrical system of the car. I can tell because with these old cables I hear the cooling fans coming on super loud which yeah the cooling fan is supposed to come on but im pretty sure the undercharging should not happen on the cable unless the battery is overheating. With this said you must open an investigation to look into these charging cables and what is changing the part numbers. It seems to me they are using different gauge wiring and type of wiring for the part that plugs into the wall.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'FORD', 'productModel': 'MUSTANG MACH E', 'manufacturer': 'Ford Motor Company'}]}\n",

The message in the app also indicated to contact the dealer immediately. I would estimate that max acceleration was instantly reduced over 30%, causing a great concern while cruising at highway speeds. Previous to the date of this incident, the warning/check engine light never turned on. I made the next exit to use secondary roads as a precautionary measure since the max acceleration was limited. I am very active in various Mach-E forums, and this is a well-known issue for Ford. These messages are the ones related to a potential design problem with the High Voltage Battery Junction Box (HVBJB) included in my vehicle (Mach-Es built on or before May 28, 2023). My production date was January 2022. This vehicle got the safety recall #22S41 (software update) at the dealer last year. The software basically allowed the driver to get these warning messages if issues with the HVBJB contactors were detected. It is noteworthy to mention that I did not get the “Stop Safely Now” message, which would have made the vehicle undrivable. Next morning the wrench symbol disappeared from my instrument cluster.   Ford issued a technical service bulletin #23-2257 to address a fix, which will involve the replacement of the potentially defective HVBJB for a redesigned one. The dealer indicated the remedy Ford provided was the software update, however multiple owners have reported the replacement of the potential defective part by Ford can only be done if the vehicle is totally inoperable showing the \"Stop Safely Now\" message.

This means according to the chart I saw online that the charging is reduced because it's overheating. So I drove it around on August 29th,2023 with a high temperature outside of 105 degrees F that day. The low I believe in Murrieta, CA that night was 70 degrees F. Since it's charging in the garage, you have to account for an extra 10-18 degrees F of heat since most garages are not air-conditioned. This coupled with the high voltage battery connector failure recall that is also currently being investigated leaves me to believe the battery itself may be overheating causing the high voltage battery connector to weld itself shut and 240v Ford charging cables to fry. With both of these issues currently happening I believe it puts us at a higher risk for a catastrophic thermal runaway event. My recommendation would be to check Ford's testing of the electrical battery system. Was it tested driven during 105 F weather then charged overnight multiple times on a 240V Ford charging cable that comes with the car? Was the fact that 10-18 Degrees F that a garage is much hotter then it is outside? I have had two charging cables fail with under 25k miles. This leads me to believe the battery is overheating and catastrophic thermal runaway is at a greater risk with all these issues.

At first I thought it was just unengineered and terrible, but i've come to the conclusion that it's possibly dangerous.  Driving yesterday on a city street and the road had a slight transition from left to right and at that very place , the road also has a bit of a bump, i hit that during the slight transition to the right and the car bounced up and the rear end almost stepped out, putting the car sideways (It did not, but slightly faster or more of an angle change, it's very possible it would have). Again as I stated before, the suspension is underdamped for the weight of the vehicle and it's quite easy for it to get unsettled, heck even just coming out of a parking lot it can get unsettled. I'm afraid someone is going to find this out the hard way and someone is going to get hurt. I'd say this is akin to loading a 1/2 ton truck with 1 ton of cargo, it is illegal and really this suspension trying to handle the battery weight, plus the car and passengers, it's just not up to the task.  As a Ford shareholder, it's not that I'd like to see Ford hurt. I'd like to see them fix this issue and actually engineer a safe suspension,a capable suspension for a vehicle that almost weighs 5K lbs.\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2022', 'productMake': 'FORD', 'productModel': 'MUSTANG MACH E', 'manufacturer': 'Ford Motor Company'}]}\n",
